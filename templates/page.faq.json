This ensures you are hitting all your muscle groups to maximise impact, and minimise overuse. <\/li><li><strong>Efficient and effective.<\/strong> Our program utilises biomechanics principles to ensure every movement is building strength - without unnecessary stress through your joints. Sound complicated? Don't worry - we do all the science-y stuff so you don't have to. <\/li><li><strong>Workouts are modifiable. <\/strong>Meaning that Alimba is suitable for everyone. We provide you with the tools to make every class feel like a personal training session. <\/li><li><strong>Focus on building muscle.<\/strong> After age 30, we lose 3-8% of our muscle mass every decade.
